public class What_Is_Class {
/*A class is a blueprint or template in object-oriented programming that defines the properties and behaviors of objects. It serves as a structure for creating objects with specific characteristics and functionalities.
 
A Class can be defined as the collection of objects that have a similar type of properties. It is a logical entity that can be seen as a blueprint for creating the objects. A Class can have many objects where each has the attributes and behavior defined by the class itself. However, we can also create a singleton class that has only a single instance.

In Java, a class can contain the following entities:

Attributes
Behavior(methods)
Constructors
Blocks
Nested class and interface


****Consider the following syntax to declare a class in java.

public class Main {  
int attr = 10; //instance variable  
}  

The 'class' keyword is used to declare a class. The class declaration may contain the following components defined in the sequence.

Access Modifier: this defines the access modifier for the class, i.e., whether the class is public, private, protected, or default.
class keyword: it is mandatory to use the class keyword to declare a class.

Class name: the class name should follow the Java naming conventions and must be in CamelCase. It should not be any keyword name also.

Superclass (if required): A class may inherit any base class, if any. The keyword extends used to inherit any base class in our class.

Interface (If required): A class may implement any interface if required. The keyword implements is used to implement any interface in our class.

Class body: the class body starts with an opening brace {and ends with a closing brace}. We can define instance variables, constructors, methods, nested classes and interfaces in the class body.

In Java, a class is only a blueprint, and the memory is occupied only when the object of the class is created. However, java provides new keyword to create an object of the class.

Consider the following example to create an object of the class and using the class's behavior with the object.
