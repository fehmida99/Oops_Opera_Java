/*Problem  : What is an Interface ?

Ans : An interface in Java is a contract or blueprint that defines a set of abstract methods that a class must implement. It specifies the behavior that a class should have without providing the implementation details. Interfaces allow for achieving abstraction, defining common behavior, and supporting multiple inheritance of types.


The interface in Java can be defined as the blueprint of the class. An interface can have abstract methods and static constants. By using the interface, we can achieve abstraction in java. We can also achieve multiple inheritance in java using interface. We cannot define the method body in the interface.

**An interface is different from abstract classes, i.e., an interface can't be instantiated, just like the abstract class. However, fields are static, public, and final in the interface, whereas; methods are public and abstract.


**WE CANT CREATE OBJECT OF INTERFACE.**

IMP:  WHY WE ARE USING INTERFACE?? WHAT IS THE NEED ??
There are the following reasons for which the interface is mainly used in java.

We can achieve multiple inheritance by using interface.
We can achieve abstraction by using interface.
Interface, in java, is also used to achieve loose coupling.


As we have already discussed, the interface is the blueprint of a class, i.e., it is implemented by a class to define its methods. However, classes implement the interface in their way. Here, we should also consider that any class that implements the interface must define its every method.



In java, the interface keyword is used to declare the interface. Consider the following syntax to declare the interface.

Interface <interface-name> {  
//constant fields  
//abstract methods  
}  


Like class, the interface can also inherit another interface. However, a class implements the interface. Consider the following image to understand the relationship between class and interface.

class     Interface       Interface
  ^           ^              ^
  |           |              |
extend    implement        implement
  |           |              |
class     Interface        Interface
